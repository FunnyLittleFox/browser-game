Project 1 Browser Game Development

The game currently in production is an attempt at a javascript mock dating simulater.   
    Base goals:
        Pick the correct cookies and the correct dialog choices to convince Fluft to let you go.
        3 correct choices = 3 hearts = release
        Failure conditions:
         - pick the 2 knockout trap cookies
         - pick the 1 poison cookie
         - insult Fluft's cookies twice
         Winning is still possible if pick just 1 of the knockout cookies just a "you are getting drowsy" type message will be displayed. (buildup to failure)

    Menu bar to link to an about page with game synopsis and a character page that will have a short profile on Fluft, Dr. Thames, and the various cookies offered

    Notes for self:
        - using css for animation ability is still weak need to keep reviewing.
        - continue using w3 and other sources for javascript help. (still makes very little sense to me when I'm stressed)  MINIMUM 2hr review EVERYNIGHT before bed regardless of current work schedule (I WILL BECOME A JAVASCRIPT GOD EVEN IF IT KILLS ME)
        - Remember the Mantra's:
            - Remember to breathe, One step at a time, It will get done, It doesn't need to be perfect, See the code be the code.
        - Keep trying to find ways to better manage the panic attacks related to doing creative work projects (CAUSE THIS FUCKING SUCKS)(Need to get out of my own way)
